.. description: I had a conversation with a friend about a mandatory trading firm's competitive advantage: having low latency access to exchange markets. Trading companies achieve low latency by leveraging ad-hoc physical infrastructure that allows them to access exchange markets fast, usually by investing upfront on their infrastructure or paying someone else to use theirs. Unfortunately, those are entry barriers for someone like me playing around with technology. So I wondered how that was in the world of cryptocurrencies.
